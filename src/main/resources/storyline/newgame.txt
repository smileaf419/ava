Opening
%Player took a step through the threshold of %G[his|her|their] open door.
A small sigh escaped %G[his|her|their] lips as %G[he|she|they] entered into the open living area.
Happy to be home a small smile peeled across %G[his|her|their] lips.
Slowly %G[he|she|they] surveyed the room checking for anything out of place.
%G[He|She|They] turned and look out of %G[his|her|their] doorway at the hill that lead to %G[his|her|their] house.

I love %World, it’s rolling plain always soothe me after long journeys.
%G[He|She|They] thought to %G[him|her|their ]self as %G[he|she|they] looked out.
Along with its wood-lands always make me want to go out more adventures.

A strong breeze suddenly surged through the open hill.
The leaves around %G[his|her|their] cabin entrance began to swirl.
%G[He|She|They] covered %G[his|her|their] face as the dust was kicked up into the air by the wind.
A figure slowly began to manifest inside the swirling leaves.
%G[He|She|They] lowered %G[his|her|their] hand just as the wind began to die down.

The figures started to become clear, her long red hair was tied into pig-tails just above her ears.
A long elegant blue dress flowed in the light breeze.
A few intricate patterns were stitched into the length of the dress.
A wooden staff sat gently in her right hand.
A small emblem was carved into each end of the staff.
Her eyes slowly opened to look at %Player.

“You must be %Player I have been waiting for you” her voice came through gentle and kind.
A puzzled expression formed on %Player's face as %G[he|she|they] cocked %G[his|her|their] head at the girl.

“I don’t believe that we have ever met may I help you miss?” %G[He|she|they] asked attempting to be as polite as possible.

“We have not, I am the woodland goddess %Goddess” she answered taking a step through the threshold.
%G[His|Her|Their] eyes slowly scanned her from bottom to top.

“I thought Goddess where supposed to be well-endowed?” %G[He|she|they] bluntly asked the flat chested girl in front of %G[him|her|them].
An ominous smile spread across her lips as she raised her right arm.
With a small movement of her wrist, the staffed smacked into the back of %G[his|her|their] head.
%G[His|Her|Their] head fell forward from the impact as let out a pained grunt.
Her eye left twitched, her face filled with rage.

“Not all of us are blessed with large breasts, you idiot!” She shouted at %G[him|her|%Player] as %G[he|she|they] rubbed the bump that slowly formed on the back of %G[his|her|them] skull.
She took a deep breath in to collect herself.
“Now I have a divine quest I would like you to embark on.” She noted with a softer tone.

%G[His|Her|Their] face changed to pure joy when she mentioned a quest.
Her left hand rose until it sat parallel to the ground.
A large plant began to sprout from the ground beneath her hand.
A sword like an object appeared to be housed in the stock of the plant.
Within a few second the hilt rose past her palm.

Her finger wrapped the now exposed sheath.
She lifted away from the plant and rested her staff on the wall.
With her free hand, she drew the curved sword out of the sheath.
The red blade shimmered against the sunlight.
She lowered the blade so the tip rested just above the dirt below.

Moments, after the blade got near the ground snow white roses, bloomed underneath it.
She pressed her thumb to the small crest on the top of the sheath.
Small sakura petals manifest around the wooden scabbard.
Her body moved forward past him like lighting.

“This blade is one I have forged myself it has some my power in it.
With it, you can make plant life grow from the ground to attack your enemies as well as the woodland flash techniques.”
She noted as the blade slid back into the scabbard.
“This is your reward if you chose to accept the quest.”

“I will gladly accept,” %Player said with an overjoyed tone as she handed %G[him|her|them] the blade.
%G[He|She|They] fastened it around %G[his|her|their] hip.

“Wonderful you will be clearing out a cave that has been infested with monsters,” she told %G[him|her|them] with a snap of her fingers.
Oak tree leaves began to surround %Player before %G[he was|she was|they were] even able to move %G[he|she|they] disappeared.

Echo wood forest
A few moments later

The Oak leaves swirled in front of a large hole next to a few trees.
%Player manifested in the center of the swirling mass.
%G[His|Her|Their] feet touched the soft ground and %G[he|she|they] stumbled forward out of the petals.

%G[His|Her|Their] body lurched forward as %G[he|she|they] fell down into the large hole.
%G[He|She|They] let out a loud gasp as %G[he|she|they] picked up speed.
%G[His|Her|Their] back bounced off the wall of the hole and shot %G[him|her|them] to the other side.
The momentum forced %G[him|her|them] to slam into the opposite wall and bounce off it.

Hitting the wall again %G[he|she|they] began to roll down the steady incline it had turned into.
Slowly %G[he|she|they] skidded to a stop, %G[his|her|their] clothes covered in dust and dirt.
%G[He|She|They] slowly rose to %G[his|her|their] feet a painful groan escaped %G[his|her|their] lips.

Once %G[he|she|they] finally got all the way back to %G[his|her|their] feet a small stone fell.
It was about the size of a hummingbird.
The stone made impact with the exact top of %Player’s head.
%G[His|Her|Their] vision blurred suddenly before everything went black.

%G[His|Her|Their] body fell backward onto the slope behind %G[him|her|them].
A small cloud of dust kicked up into the air as %G[he|she|they] hit the dirt.
